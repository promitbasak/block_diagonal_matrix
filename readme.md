# Block Diagonal Matrix

The data structure is implemented in Python. The BlockDiagonalMatrix class is designed to
represent and perform efficient operations on matrices composed of smaller diagonal blocks. The
goal is to leverage the inherent structure of such matrices to reduce both memory usage and
computational complexity for common matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and
inversion.
